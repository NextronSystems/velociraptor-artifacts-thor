name: Generic.Scanner.Thor
description: |
   Generic artifact for THOR (enterprise) forensic scanner (https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor/) running on Windows, Linux and Darwin systems.
   <br/>This artifact creates and downloads valid licenses and binaries for each host on the fly using the "PortalKey" parameter (and if needed the Portal contract ID), see https://thor-manual.nextron-systems.com/en/latest/usage/deployment.html#retrieve-valid-license-from-customer-portal . 

   Caution: 
   <br/>THOR might exceed the default "Max Execution Time in Seconds", we suggest setting it to 30000 sec (~8.5h).
   <br/>Since THOR monitors itself and the system regarding resource usage and limits, additional "resource limits" in the Hunt settings are not needed.

   Caution:
   <br/>Be aware that the Portal API key is send to an potentially compromised host! It might be a good idea to change it frequently to avoid getting it stolen!

   Reports (.html/.txt/.json) are uploaded to Velociraptor server.
   <br/>The THOR json log and the number of alerts/warnings/notices/errors can be found in the Flow details "Results" tab or in the Hunt "Notebook". 
   This allows a quick triage.
