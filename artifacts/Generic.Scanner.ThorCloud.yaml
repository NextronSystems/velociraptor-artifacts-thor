   Generic artifact for THOR CLOUD forensic scanner (https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor-cloud/) running on Windows, Linux and Darwin systems.

   This artifact needs a THOR Cloud launcher token, which can be copied from the 'Launcher' options ('token') from within the campaign view.
   
   Caution: 
   <br/>THOR might exceed the default "Max Execution Time in Seconds", we suggest setting it to 30000 sec (~8.5h).
   <br/>Since THOR monitors itself and the system regarding resource usage and limits, additional "resource limits" in the Hunt settings are not needed.
   <br/>Also, keep in mind that for this artifacts to work, the clients need to have network access to the THOR Cloud backend ( https://thorcloud-lite.nextron-systems.com ) !
