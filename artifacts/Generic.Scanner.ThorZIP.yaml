name: Generic.Scanner.ThorZIP
description: |
   Generic artifact for THOR (LITE) forensic scanner (https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor/) running on Windows, Linux and Darwin systems.
   <br/>Mostly made for THOR LITE, for THOR enterprise see Generic.Scanner.Thor.
   
   This arifact expects a ZIP with THOR (LITE) binaries, licenses and signatures via the "tools" config 'ThorZIP'.
   <br/>ZIP file is downloaded to client host, unzipped and based on OS and architecture the right file is executed.

   Caution: 
   <br/>THOR might exceed the default "Max Execution Time in Seconds", we suggest setting it to 30000 sec (~8.5h).
   <br/>Since THOR monitors itself and the system regarding resource usage and limits, additional "resource limits" in the Hunt settings are not needed.

   Reports (.html/.txt/.json) are uploaded to Velociraptor server.
   <br/>The THOR json log and the number of alerts/warnings/notices/errors can be found in the Flow details "Results" tab or in the Hunt "Notebook". 
   This allows a quick triage.
